# Assessment 3
For this assignment I had to make multiple visualisations from 1 dataset. The data must be updated and they must be linked.

## Dairy queen
I was thinking of how I want to do this assignment. I was searching for a dataset, whil eating cheese, and I found a dataset on CBS that's all about dairy products. How many are being imported every year. I went with it, because my guts and stomach were telling me to. I made a battleplan for how I wanted to do this. I wanted something simple and fun. That's when I came up with the idea to make it so that you can see the year with all the data in it. If you click on the year, the second bar must show how many butter and cheese that were from the chosen year. The graph must adjust this in a smooth way. Oke let's goooo~.

## Realizing my idea
I started by picking a chart. I went with my ol' buddy: The barchart. After that I had to clean up the data. Lucky for me, I did this before in a homework assignment AND for assignment 2. This was no problem. The next step was making a second graph. I have also done this before in project 1 for Information Design. It was pretty much 'copy-paste' and changing the name, so they don't override each other. Now the tricky part, making the data link. I was struggling with finding a good way online, so I asked my classmates for help. Lucky me, Wesley showed me a easy and functional way to do this; saving the data in a empty variable and using JSON to fill it up. After showing me a good example I followed what he learned me and soon I found that it worked. Happy me.

## Conclusion
It was a long and tough road, but I'm happy with what I have made. I learned a lot from the d3 classes and I want to go even deeper. For some reason, d3 fascinates me.
